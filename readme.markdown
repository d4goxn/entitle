# Entitle

This will be an app for comparing, ranking and commenting on titles. At the moment, it is a minimal boilerplate example for a badass SPA stack:

* React
* Jest test runner, with Jasmine style tests
* Browserify

The style rules are partially configured in `.editorconfig`, `.jscsrc` and `.jshintrc`. Unfortunately, they do not play well with JSX templates.
